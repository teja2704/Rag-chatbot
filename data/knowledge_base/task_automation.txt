The intelligent chatbot supports automation of repetitive and
decision-based tasks.

Based on user intent, the system can trigger actions such as report
generation, notifications, scheduling, and data updates.

Task automation is handled separately from information retrieval
to maintain modular system design.

This integration allows users to interact with automation workflows
using natural language.
