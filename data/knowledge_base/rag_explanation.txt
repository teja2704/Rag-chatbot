Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that combines
information retrieval with large language models to produce accurate
and grounded responses.

Instead of relying only on the model’s internal training data,
RAG retrieves relevant information from external documents and
provides it as context to the language model before generating an answer.

This allows the system to answer questions based on up-to-date,
private, or domain-specific knowledge that the model may not have
seen during training.

RAG is commonly used in enterprise chatbots, document assistants,
and question-answering systems where factual accuracy is important.
